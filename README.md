# Election_Analysis
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run to complete the audit:

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout
