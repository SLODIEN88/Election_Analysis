 ## Challenge Summary 
Overall, the script was able to produce the results asked for. But, I noticed the script could have been modified further. But, none the less, we still delivered what was asked of us. Some of the things we could have looked at, would have been the popularity of the candidate geographically to determine who was most ppular or not in that county
I wish we were also give more information like the ages, and the bio data, this would have helped us to really narrow it down
