  - In 2nd place, was Charles Casper Stockham who receive 23% of the total votes
  - in 3rd plave, was Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1% of the total votes
 
 ## Challenge Summary 
 I noticed the code would have been modified further to other stuff other than the counties and the candidates. But, none the less, we still delivered what was asked of us. some of the things we could have looked at, would have been the popularity of the candidate geographically to determine who was most ppular or not in that county
 I wish we were also give more information like the ages, and the bio data, this would have helped us to really narrow it down the board.
